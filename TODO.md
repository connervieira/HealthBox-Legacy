# TODO


## Planned

Tasks in this section are tasks that are actively being worked on, and will almost certainly appear in HealthBox in the future.

- [x] Create base HealthBox functionality.
- [x] Create a sample application to demonstrate reading and writing information to HealthBox.
- [x] Create a more fluid and seamless download and installation experience from the V0LT website.
- [x] Add 'MealID' and 'FoodID' values to nutrient samples, which are UUIDs of a certain length generated by sources and store in HealthBox to keep track of which nutrient samples correlate to which specific foods and meals are linked to each nutrient sample.
- [ ] Add input validation to the API to prevent sources from submitting malformed data.
- [ ] Add a way to remove data from HealthBox other than manually editing the database.


## Potential

Tasks in this section are things that may happen down the road, but aren't a priority.

- [ ] Create GUI front end for users not comfortable with the command line.
